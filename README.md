**# SoftwareCapstone**
An application was made for our Senior Software Capstone. People new to Charlotte and even current Charlotte residents want to find enjoyable local activities to do in their free time. Finding those activities can be challenging since finding event information or where they are is hard. Our website can create one place where people can easily find local Charlotte activities on a simple map tailored to their interests.

**UI/UX Description**
Main Event Feed
The homepage offers a clear, uncluttered feed of local events, giving users an overview of available activities. Each event includes basic information like the title, location, image, and time, allowing users to quickly find relevant activities.
Filter options: Users can filter events by categories, dates, or other options, improving the ability to tailor the search to personal preferences.
Search Bar: A top navigation bar allows for quick searching of events, enhancing the overall usability by enabling users to easily type in keywords.

Event Spotlight & Details
Users are taken to a detailed event page when clicking on a specific event. These pages are designed to provide further insights into events with rich media and possibly user-generated comments, though comment functionality is likely limited until the event begins.
Map Integration: Each eventâ€™s location is tied to a map, helping users visualize where the activity takes place, and making it simple to decide based on proximity.
Comments Section: The prototype shows a comment section but indicates it may be disabled until event day, which could be designed to foster real-time engagement only when most relevant.

Login/Sign-up Process
The sign-up and login screens follow a minimalistic design, encouraging a smooth onboarding experience for users.
Create Account: Easy to navigate, providing fields to fill in profile information that aligns with the event preferences, allowing for a more personalized experience.
Profile Management & User Dashboard

A user dashboard provides a summary of their profile details, tracked events, and personalized event suggestions based on preferences.
Account Management Design: This part of the design demonstrates a user-friendly approach to managing personal data, with a clean layout featuring editable fields like location, name, etc.

Design Elements
Clean, Minimalist Interface: The design maintains simplicity by using flat, neutral colors (green, purple, blue) that keep the focus on the content (events, maps, profiles). This allows users to navigate the site without visual clutter.

Interactive Components:
Search and Filter tools allow users to easily explore events based on their preferences, ensuring the experience feels personalized and not overwhelming.
Event Cards are clickable, allowing users to dive deeper into individual events. These cards likely include event-specific details in a readable and accessible way.
Engagement Features: Elements like the comment section (even if disabled) suggest future opportunities for social engagement, such as sharing experiences or providing event feedback.
